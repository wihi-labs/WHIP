# Abstract
The WiHi Expert program is a mechanism to grow WiHi’s community of active supporters (see DAO Onion in [WHIP-2](https://github.com/wihi-labs/WHIP/blob/main/0002-wihi-dao/main.md)).  

It is intended to be a pool of active individuals that regularly *extend WiHi's capabilities within the organisation*. 

This WHIP-5 specifies the structure, goals and mechanisms of the Expert program.


# Specification

Experts must regularly extend WiHi's capabilities within the organisation. 

For this, they receive WiHi rewards which are taken from a community fund (see [WHIP-3](https://github.com/wihi-labs/WHIP/blob/main/0003-ambassador-program.md)) that is filled with tokens from the treasury. Fiat payouts are not possible and only used to cover expenses that have been agreed on a priori.

## Application/ Acceptance of an expert

In order to become an expert, the individual has to be nominated by a supporter, contributor or core team member (the promoter). In case the nomination has support of at least 2 community fund multi-sig members, the promoter negotiates the terms and condition of the individuals expert role, summarizes them in an one-Pager that illustrates the i) goals, ii) reward amount, iii) contact details of the expert, and stores the
onePager in the [open proposals folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/164We6FinxvUBoI_dF00Kz2rw7c5gsyqf?usp=sharing). The naming of the one pager is expert-ID-NameOfExpert (where ID is a continuous index).
If the necessary minimum of supporting community fund multi-sig members support the proposal (supporting members need to be
named in the onePager, decision is taken by voting on-chain on a respective proposal within the community treasury multi-sig once established), the expert is accepted (which is signaled by storing the pdf of the onePager in the [accepted supporter folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s_nJuHrl7OtXMpqe-kM3KV9S9jRflCJO?usp=sharing)) and the details are entered in the 
[list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qgRbz1v1Pr6EUpWY8iiX_MVQecFiP1KW0tm6C4wx-l8/edit?usp=sharing). 

## Reward schemes

Different reward schemes are possible and can be combined on a case-by-case basis:

1. *Grants*
- No more than *thrice* the amount a miner could receive in the period of a year
- Examples
    - Airdrops [optional]
    - Monthly/ yearly/ one-time token distribution that may be vested [optional]
    - Monthly/ yearly/ one time token compensation that are locked and vested similar to team compensation [required]
2. *Prizes*
    - Received for specific contributions (defined, discussed, approved during community build-up calls) and agreed to with an expert in writing
    - Related to the expert knowledge of an expert
    - Award amounts are directly related to benefit accrued to WiHi; rewards amounts can be paid out in proportion to the benefit or a one-time payout for achieving a certain goal

## Rights and duties of an expert

Experts have the right 
- to call themselves a “WiHi Expert”
- to access the Logo and CIs folder of WiHi
- to access the WiHi supporter folder
- To have the supporter status on discord (and see the corresponding channels)
- To view the [accepted supporters folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s_nJuHrl7OtXMpqe-kM3KV9S9jRflCJO?usp=sharing)  
- To gain access to specific competence area channels that are located in the contributor category if decided by the corresponding competence area

Experts have the duty
- to share their expert knowledge with the WiHi community when needed
- to make sure that they are not perceived as official representatives of WiHi but as active community members. In particular, it has to be clear that the views shared of them are their own and do not represent WiHi.
