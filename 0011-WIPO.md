# Abstract
The WiHi Point (WiPo) is a test token for the WiHi platform and organization to try out different functionalities and features.

# Specification 
The WiHi Point (WiPo) is a fungible, transferable, uncapped and pre-mined test token that has no Source of value (see [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03256-w) for definitions). Sources of value might be added over time. The sole purpose of the token is to test out functionalities and features of WiHis platform and organization.

In its first iteration, the WiPo will be used to test WiHi's community fund mechanism illustrated in [WHIP-0003](https://github.com/wihi-labs/WHIP/blob/main/0003-ambassador-program.md). In particular, it will be controlled by [Michael](https://twitter.com/0xchiuchiutrain), [Uros](https://twitter.com/urosnoetic) and [Mark](https://twitter.com/BallandiesMC) with a 3-2-multisig wallet, is filled with 2000000 (2 million) units and will be used to reward ambassadors, experts, builders and other emerging supporter roles (see [WHIP-0002](https://github.com/wihi-labs/WHIP/blob/main/0002-wihi-dao/main.md)).
Hence, WiPos first usage is as a unit of account to keep track of the contributions of early supporters to WiHi.   


# Motivation
WiPo was already mentioned in [WHIP-0003](https://github.com/wihi-labs/WHIP/blob/main/0003-ambassador-program.md). A specification is made in this document.
In particular, WiHi is a community-driven decentralized autonomous organization. In order to be able to scale the addition of new supporters to our DAO and track their contributions, we think the most efficient way to do this is with the help of an on-chain token.

# Rationale
The token is uncapped in order to account for the potentially uncapped amount of contributions supporters will provide to the WiHi platform.
