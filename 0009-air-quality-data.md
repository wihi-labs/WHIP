# Abstract 
[Air Gradient](https://www.airgradient.com) is an open-source and
open-hardware hardware manufacturer that fits well with WiHi.

More importantly, Air Gradient represents an opportunity for WiHi to
codify procedures and policies for on-boarding weather and climate
data manufacturing companies and their community members.

# Specification 

WiHi should engage with Air Gradient to see what modes of collaboration are possible. 

The goal is to have Air Gradient become part of the WiHi community. 

The following items should be completed before engaging:

1. Landing page describing WiHi
2. WiHi data policy for data contributors 
3. Design of a WiHi community on-boarding procedure
4. WiHi community standard operation procedure (SOP) 

## WiHi Data Policy

The retail market that most weather and climate data hardware
manufacturers target comprise the hobbyist community of weather 
and climate data providers. The current status quo is that hobbyist
communities provide their data freely to the original OEM in return 
for:
- a front-end to visualize the data they've contributed
- a back-end for archival of historical data.

WiHi must construct a suitable data policy that addresses:
- Whether data should be freely contributed or not
- Whether data should be freely archived. (If so, who/what is the product?)
- What access to data does a data contributor have or retain

# Motivation 

Objectively, Air Gradient is a great fit for WiHi due to their stated organizational values of being open-source and open-hardware. Forming a relationship with Air Gradient is mutually beneficial:

1. Air Gradient community members can get compensated for their (data) contributions commensurate to the quality of their contributions.

2. Air Gradient gains access to the WiHi community.

3. WiHi gains community members interested in measuring air quality
