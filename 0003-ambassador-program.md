# Abstract 

The WiHi Ambassador program is a mechanism to grow WiHi’s community of active supporters.  

It is intended to be a pool of active individuals that regularly and pro-actively promote and/ or support WiHi meaningfully and or visibly to the outside (see DAO Onion in [WHIP-2](https://github.com/wihi-labs/WHIP/blob/main/0002-wihi-dao/main.md)). 

This WHIP-3 specifies the structure, goals and mechanisms of the Ambassador program.

# Specification 

Ambassadors must regularly and pro-actively promote and/ or support WiHi meaningfully and/ or visibly to the outside (see DAO Onion). 

For this, they receive WiHi rewards which are taken from a community fund that is filled with tokens from the treasury. Fiat payouts are not possible and only used to cover expenses that have been agreed on a priori.

## Community fund

The community fund is a 3-2-multi-sig wallet that is initially filled with 250000 WiHi points (WIPO - WiHi's test tokens) to support programs that are located within/ target the friend and supporter layers in the DAO onion. It is controlled by a subset of individuals from the community CA. In its first iteration, this group will consist of Michael, Uros, and Mark.
Until another mechanism is proposed, the community fund is refilled by a WHIP. The individuals controlling the fund are either re-elected by a WHIP or assigned by those already controlling the fund.

## Application/ Acceptance of an ambassador

In order to become an ambassador, the individual has to be nominated by a supporter, contributor or core team member (the promoter). In case the nomination has support of at least 2
community fund multi-sig members, the promoter negotiates the terms and condition of the individuals ambassador role, summarizes them in an one-Pager that illustrates the i) goals, ii) reward amount, iii) contact details of the ambassador, and stores the
onePager in the [open proposals folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cWxiwhtN1a6-teq-Nj_QDLiplEhzBTjJ?usp=sharing). The naming of the one pager is ambassador-ID-NameOfAmbassador (where ID is a continuous index according to the supporter table)
If the necessary minimum of supporting community fund multi-sig members support the proposal (supporting members need to be
named in the onePager), the ambassador is accepted (which is signaled by storing the pdf of the onePager in the [accepted proposals folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P6e98ZTY2ItKZIqVigK84mh-WkmbI_mJ?usp=sharing)) and the details are entered in the 
[list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EBO-G-uDC6arYudOhIIZk7rDy2zo5UJc/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111110313573215603604&rtpof=true&sd=true). The ambassador has to be announced in a channel of the supporter category on discord.

## Reward schemes

Different reward schemes are possible and can be combined on a case-by-case basis:

1. *Grants*
- No more than twice the amount a miner could receive in the period of a year
- Examples
    - Airdrops [optional]
    - Monthly/ yearly/ one-time token distribution that may be vested [optional]
    - Monthly/ yearly/ one time token compensation that are locked and vested similar to team compensation [required]
2. *Prizes*
    - Received for achieving specified targets (defined, discussed, approved during community build-up calls) and shared among als supporters via a task list
    - Related to network growth goals such as obtaining clients and/or on-boarding miners
    - Award amounts are directly related to benefit accrued to WiHi; rewards amounts can be paid out in proportion to the benefit (e.g., a certain amount of WiHi tokens per miner on-boarded) or a one-time payout for achieving a certain goal (e.g., a certain amount of WiHi tokens for on-boarding a certain amount of miners)

## Rights and duties of an ambassador


Ambassadors have the right 
- to call themselves a “WiHi Ambassador”
- to access the Logo and CIs folder of WiHi
- To have the supporter status on discord
- To view the [accepted supporter folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P6e98ZTY2ItKZIqVigK84mh-WkmbI_mJ?usp=sharing)  
- To view the WiHi supporter drive

Ambassadors have the duty
- to regularly and pro-actively promote and/ or support WiHi meaningfully and or visibly to the outside
- to actively participate in the biweekly WiHi ambassador call and/or the supporter channels on discord
- to make sure that they are not perceived as official representatives of WiHi but as active community members. In particular, it has to be clear that the views shared of them are their own and do not represent WiHi.
