# Abstract 

The WiHi Ambassador program is a mechanism to grow WiHi’s community of active supporters.  

It is intended to be a pool of active individuals that regularly and pro-actively promote and/ or support WiHi meaningfully and or visibly to the outside (see DAO Onion in WHIP-2). 

This WHIP-3 specifies the structure, goals and mechanisms of the Ambassador program.

# Specification 

Ambassadors must regularly and pro-actively promote and/ or support WiHi meaningfully and or visibly to the outside (see DAO Onion). 

For this, they receive WiHi rewards which are taken from a community fund that is filled with tokens from the treasury. Fiat payouts are not possible and only used to cover expenses that have been agreed on a priori.

## Community fund

The community fund is a 3-2-multi-sig wallet that is initially filled with X WiHi tokens to finance the ambassador program. It is controlled by a subset of individuals from the community CA. In its first iteration, this group will consist of Michael, Uros, and Mark.
Until another mechanism is proposed, the community fund is refilled and the individuals controlling the fund are re-elected by a WHIP that updates this WHIP.

## Application/ Acceptance of an ambassador

In order to become an ambassador, the individual has to be nominated by a core team member (the promoter). In case the nomination has support of at least 2
community fund multi-sig members, the promoter negotiates the terms and condition of the individuals ambassador role, summarizes
them in an one-Pager that illustrates the i) goals, ii) reward amount, iii) contact details of the ambassador, and stores the
onePager in the [open proposals folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/164We6FinxvUBoI_dF00Kz2rw7c5gsyqf?usp=sharing) . The naming of the one pager is ID-Name (where ID
is a continous index)
If the necessary minimum of supporting community fund multi-sig members support the proposal (supporting members need to be
named in the onePager), the ambassador is accepted (which is signaled by storing the pdf of the onePager in the [accepted ambassadors folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s_nJuHrl7OtXMpqe-kM3KV9S9jRflCJO?usp=sharing)) and the details are entered in the 
[list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qgRbz1v1Pr6EUpWY8iiX_MVQecFiP1KW0tm6C4wx-l8/edit?usp=sharing). 

## Reward schemes

Different reward schemes are possible and can be combined on a case-by-case basis:

1. *Grants*
- No more than twice the amount a miner could receive in the period of a year
- Examples
    - Airdrops [optional]
    - Monthly/ yearly/ one-time token distribution that may be vested [optional]
    - Monthly/ yearly/ one time token compensation that are locked and vested similar to team compensation [required]
2. *Prizes*
    - Received for achieving specified targets (defined, discussed, approved during community build-up calls) and agreed to with an ambassador in writing
    - Related to network growth goals such as obtaining clients and/or on-boarding miners
    - Award amounts are directly related to benefit accrued to WiHi; rewards amounts can be paid out in proportion to the benefit (e.g., a certain amount of WiHi tokens per miner on-boarded) or a one-time payout for achieving a certain goal (e.g., a certain amount of WiHi tokens for on-boarding a certain amount of miners)

## Rights and duties of an ambassador

A dedicated WiHi ambassador channel is created on discord that is visible by all supporters, contributors and core team members of WiHi.

Ambassadors have the right 
- to call themselves a “WiHi Ambassador”
- to access the Logo and CIs folder of WiHi
- To have the supporter status on discord
- To view the [accepted ambassadors folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s_nJuHrl7OtXMpqe-kM3KV9S9jRflCJO?usp=sharing)  

Ambassadors have the duty
- to regularly and pro-actively promote and/ or support WiHi meaningfully and or visibly to the outside
- to actively participate in the biweekly WiHi ambassador call and/or the WiHi ambassador channel on discord
- to make sure that they are not perceived as official representatives of WiHi but as active community members. In particular, it has to be clear that the views shared of them are their own and do not represent WiHi.



# Motivation

Ambassador programs have proven to be impactful to grow community (e.g. as we observed in onocoy).
