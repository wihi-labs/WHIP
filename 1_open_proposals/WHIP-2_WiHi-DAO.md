# Abstract 
The WiHi DAO is the organizational structure that the WiHi community gives itself to achieve its vision to provide weather predictions anytime and anywhere on earth. It follows the principles of collective intelligence and self-organization to manage its complex 3-sided market consisting of weather data providers, data consumers and platform maintainers/ developers/ facilitators.

![WiHi DAO onion](../0_images/wihi_DAO_onion.png)
The DAO consists of 5 layers, as illustrated in the figure above. The public can join the DAO by following WiHi in one of its channels (e.g. Twitter, Discord, etc.). By starting to interact with members of upper layers in the DAO and/ or by owning WiHi tokens, a follower can become a friend of WiHi. Friends that actively start supporting WiHi by performing dedicated tasks for it success are becoming supporters of WiHi. Those supporters that spend a considerable amount of their time supporting WiHi become contributors. Contributors that take larger responsibility within the DAO can become core team members.

The core team itself is self-organized in areas of competence that radiate out into the other layers.

## Operational Rules:
1. core team votes to add new core members or remove existing ones;
2. Any core team member can open new competence areas (CA)
3. Competence areas organize themselves
4. Any layer can level up others until level below (in the DAO Onion)
5. Anyone is empowered to join any CA as a follower
6. CA manage a (monthly) budget of tokens they can spend (can be 0). Either the CA receives tokens by an entity already owning tokens or requests them via an improvement proposal.
7. CA can decide to “outsource” work on a token basis
8. Fiat compensation requires alignment within core team

## Rights/ obligations
The following table illustrates the rights and obligations of each layer in greater detail.

# Motivation


# Rationale

The purpose of WiHi’s governance is to i) enable participation of all stakeholders (incl. users); ii) enable autonomous
improvement; and iii) prevent power concentration by any one stakeholder or a group of stakeholders. These elements, in
combination, facilitate WiHi’s collective intelligence [Ballandies, 2023], which can manage the network successfully
in a rapidly changing and complex environment.
