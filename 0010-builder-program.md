# Abstract
The WiHi builder program is a mechanism to grow WiHi’s community of active supporters (see DAO Onion in [WHIP-2](https://github.com/wihi-labs/WHIP/blob/main/0002-wihi-dao/main.md)).  

It is intended to be a pool of active individuals that regularly *build out the WiHi platform*. 

This WHIP-10 specifies the structure, goals and mechanisms of the Builder program.

# Specification 
Builders must regularly build out the WiHi platform. 

For this, they receive WiHi rewards which are taken from a community fund (see [WHIP-3](https://github.com/wihi-labs/WHIP/blob/main/0003-ambassador-program.md)) that is filled with tokens from the treasury. Fiat payouts are not possible and only used to cover expenses that have been agreed on a priori.

## Application/ Acceptance of a builder

In order to become a builder, the individual has to be nominated by a supporter, contributor or core team member (the promoter). In case the nomination has support of at least 2 community fund multi-sig members, the promoter negotiates the terms and condition of the individuals builder role, summarizes them in an one-Pager that illustrates the i) goals, ii) reward amount, iii) contact details of the builder, and stores the
onePager in the [open proposals folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cWxiwhtN1a6-teq-Nj_QDLiplEhzBTjJ?usp=sharing). The naming of the one pager is builder-ID-NameOfBuilder (where ID is a continuous index).
If the necessary minimum of supporting community fund multi-sig members support the proposal (supporting members need to be
named in the onePager, decision is taken by voting on-chain on a respective proposal within the community treasury multi-sig once established), the builder is accepted (which is signaled by storing the pdf of the onePager in the [accepted supporter folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P6e98ZTY2ItKZIqVigK84mh-WkmbI_mJ?usp=sharing)) and the details are entered in the 
[list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EBO-G-uDC6arYudOhIIZk7rDy2zo5UJc/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111110313573215603604&rtpof=true&sd=true). 

## Reward schemes

Different reward schemes are possible and can be combined on a case-by-case basis:

1. *Grants*
- Examples
    - Airdrops [optional]
    - Monthly/ yearly/ one-time token distribution that may be vested [optional]
    - Monthly/ yearly/ one time token compensation that are locked and vested similar to team compensation [required]
2. *Prizes*
    - Received for specific contributions (defined, discussed, approved during community build-up calls) and agreed to with a builder in writing
    - Related to the builders contribution
    - Award amounts are directly related to benefit accrued to WiHi; rewards amounts can be paid out in proportion to the benefit or a one-time payout for achieving a certain goal

## Rights and duties of a Builder

Builders have the right 
- to call themselves a “WiHi Builder”
- to access the Logo and CIs folder of WiHi
- to access the WiHi supporter folder
- To have the supporter status on discord (and see the corresponding channels)
- To view the [accepted supporters folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P6e98ZTY2ItKZIqVigK84mh-WkmbI_mJ?usp=sharing)  
- To view the WiHi supporter drive
- To gain access to specific competence area channels that are located in the contributor category if decided by the corresponding competence area

Builders have the duty
- to actively build out the WiHi platform
- to make sure that they are not perceived as official representatives of WiHi but as active community members. In particular, it has to be clear that the views shared of them are their own and do not represent WiHi.

# Motivation
Everyone supporting/ contributing to WiHi are part of the DAO. Everyone having a token can be part of the DAO. Those who actively and regularly support WiHi are at least supporters wihin our DAOonion (see [WHIP-2](https://github.com/wihi-labs/WHIP/blob/main/0002-wihi-dao/main.md)). Hence those building out WiHi who are neither contributors nor core team members require an own role within the supporter layer. This WHIP fills the gap. 

# Rationale
Builders, even if in the beginning contributing on a fully contractual/ rational/ token-seeking motivation, are members of our DAO as they a) have a bi-directional relationship with us, and b) own tokens. Hence, for onboarding new builders we can use the onboarding mechanisms we have already in place for other supporter roles. In particular, in future this could scale (as supporters could suggest new supporters, etc.) and thus accelerate WiHi's platform build out.
